<h2>Description</h2>

<p>My favorite burgers are 'Surprise Burgers'. The pineapple inside the burger adds a hint of sweetness, while the sauce adds some tanginess! Warning: the added sauce and pineapple makes for a mess with little ones! </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>4 pineapple rings</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cup ketchup</li>
    <li>1/2 brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard</li>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat a grill for high heat.</li>
    <li>Divide the ground beef into four portions, and form patties around pineapple rings so that none of the pineapple is showing. In a small saucepan, mix together the ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard. Heat until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>Place burgers on the grill, and cook for about 5 minutes per side, or until well done. Spoon some of the brown sugar sauce over the burgers before serving.</li>
